# EvilAutomaticSubnetter
This is named "Evil" simply because I didn't add any comments in the code, no documentation, no formatting, and uses a simple plain console.
Subnets given IP addr. (only beginning is needed.) and outputs data such as:
  * Beginning of the IP addr. (inputted by user.)
  * Default Mask
  * Default CIDR
  * IP Class (A,B,C)
  * Determinating Factor (Host/N/A inputted by user.)
  * Subnet bits
  * Host bits
  * Custom subnet
  * Custom CIDR
# Notes
  * This was created for one of my classes.
  * This only does what I needed it to do, nothing more. (Doesn't calculate for A/B class networks.)
